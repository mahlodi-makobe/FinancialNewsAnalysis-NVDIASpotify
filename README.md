# Financial News Analysis: NVIDIA and Spotify

This project analyzes financial news articles related to **NVIDIA** and **Spotify** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The dataset contains headlines, summaries, and publication dates, making it ideal for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. The goal is to extract actionable insights, such as identifying negative sentiment, uncovering key topics, and detecting relationships between entities.

## **Code Structure**
The project is organized into the following steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Load and inspect the dataset.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify topics.
4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract and analyze key entities.
5. **Keyword Extraction**: Use TF-IDF to identify important keywords.
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of the articles.
7. **Final Report**: Summarize the findings and provide recommendations.

## **Bilingual Capabilities**
This project showcases my **polyglot skills** by handling a **multilingual dataset** containing both **Portuguese** and **English** text. Hereâ€™s how I tackled the challenge:
1. **Language Detection**: Used libraries like `langdetect` to identify the language of each text snippet.
2. **Translation**: Translated Portuguese text to English using the `googletrans` library for consistent analysis.
3. **Bilingual Preprocessing**: Applied text preprocessing techniques (e.g., stopword removal, stemming) to both languages, ensuring accurate and meaningful results.
4. **Bilingual Reporting**: Provided insights and visualizations in both **English** and **Portuguese** to make the analysis accessible to a wider audience.
